## Gradient Descent in Practice I

* we use it to **speed up gradient descent ---> each value has the same range**
  * feature scaling: rescales the feature so that **-1<= x\_i <= 1**
    * **divided x\_i by range**
  * mean normalization: make the **mean of the input = 0** ---> the numerator will be 0

    * s\_i can either be **range or standard deviation**
    * **normal distribution**
